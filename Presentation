Notes from Alex and Neil:
1)a. Interior: βραχὺ διασταλτέον μετὰ τὸ αὐλῶν καὶ ἐνοπήν.

βραχυ ("faint") is to be understood after the αὐλῶν and ἐνοπήν (sound of autos).

1) b.	Main: ὅτι ἐνθάδε καὶ ἐπι τῆς ὁπλοποιϊας τῶν αὐλῶν μέμνηται. αὐλοὶ φόρμιγγές τε βοῶν. δεῖ δὲ καὶ τὸ ἀκούων προσ ὑπακούειν ἔξωθεν βράχυ δὲ διασταλτέον μετὰ τὸ αὐλῶν ἐνοπήν, ἐσημειώσατο δὲ δια τοῦ ἤχου ὅτι παρα τοῖς βαρβάροις ἐγινώσκετο τὸ ὄργανα ταῦτα⁑

Because, call to mind αυλων there in "The Gathering of Arms" (Book 18). Flutes and lyres were crying out. And it is necessary to understand that ἀκούων is in reference to "εξωθεν", 
and βράχυ is to be understood after the αὐλῶν and ἐνοπήν, (This fact) points (aorist?) out by the sound that these instruments were perceived to be coming from (lit. in the presence of) the Trojans ("βαρβάροις")

2) a. Intermarginal: τὸ εξῆς εστι συν αυτῷ τεκτήναιτο μῆτιν

Main: εἰσὶν ἀνέγνωσιν καθ ἒν μεροσ λόγου ὡς εὔμητιν κακῶς. δύο γάρ ἐστι μέρη λόγου σὺν καὶ μῆτιν τὸ δὲ εξῆς ἐστι συντέμοισι συντεκτήναι τὸ μῆτιν⁑
